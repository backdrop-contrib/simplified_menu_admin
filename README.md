# Simplified Menu Admin

This module simplifies the core Menu and Shortcut modules by merging the "List
links" and "Configure menu" operations into a single administration page.

If you've ever accidentally clicked "Edit menu" hoping to edit the most
important part of a menu (the links) but then found that all you could do from
that page was edit the menu's name and description instead, this module is for
you. It gets rid of the "List links" terminology and consolidates everything
under the "Configure menu" page, where most people will naturally look for it.
